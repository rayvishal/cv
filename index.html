      <h4>There is a quote sayingüëá<h4>
      <p><b>Read What You Love Until You love to Read - Naval ravikant</p></b>
      <p>This quote is quite true and it works, if you want to develop a habit of reading then you must read what you want to read first that can be anything, magazine, article or novel and Once you develop a habit of reading then you read what books should be read.For example in my case I used to like watching Romantic and thriller movies so i wanted to read books so i picked up romantic book that is Your dreams are mine now by Ravinder singh(Romantic book) and then i picked up One indian girl by chetan bhagat then The girl in Room 1O5(Thrilling book) and so on and so on.... that is how i develop the habbit of reading.</p>
      <p>Some of the books which i have read and i would recommend you too are</p>
